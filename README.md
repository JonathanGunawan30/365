# 🧠 365 Days of Coding Challenge

This repository is my personal challenge to code every day for 365 days — solving algorithmic and programming problems using **Java**, similar to platforms like LeetCode, TLX, or CodeWars.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- `365-season1/` — Solutions for **Day 1 to Day XX** (initial season)
- `365-season2/` — Continuation starting from **Day 1**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java 21**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (project structure based on `.iml` and `.idea/` files)

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run solutions using your IDE or from terminal (adjust paths as needed):

```bash
javac 365-season2/Day001_HelloWorld.java
java 365-season2.Day001_HelloWorld
